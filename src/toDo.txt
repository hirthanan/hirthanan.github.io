Things to Implement:

Idea: Creating a responsive website to advertise myself through details about me, projects I've done, 
      displaying an up-to-date resume, and contact information (eg. github, linkedIn, email)
      
Start with:

1) Create a navigation bar that is transparent and responsive to the website where as it will scroll down with the site
    -> navigation bar consists of the title; Home, About Me, Projects, Resume, Contact Info
    -> Navbar should scale with resizing the browser
    
2) Learn how to make the page dynamically resize when changing page layout

3) Implement angularJS into the project, and use property ng-model to link input textbox name entered to guide user through site

4) Make the resume open on a new tab with pdf
    -> Fix hyperlinks on resume




Tips to remember: 
-> Use min-width when doing responsive design since it will stop ruining things when resizing browser
-> at min-width all to keep decreasing browser size but scale everything down as well
